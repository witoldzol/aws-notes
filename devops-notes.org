*ECS

There are 2 types of IAM roles: 
- ECS instance roles ( EC2 )
- Task roles

ECS provisions EC2's using ASG

Autoscaling in ECS is very tricky: 
how do you connect metrics from tasks & tie them to ASG that is running EC2's hosting tasks?
One solution is to use Beanstalk to run ECS Cluster for us and handle autoscaling
Other: use Fargate to manage/provision EC2's

Metrics:
You can have cluster & service level metrics 
'task insights' provides metrics on individual tasks ( NEW & paid service )

Logs:
No need for CW Agent to send logs from tasks 
Instance logs can be obtained only if we install CW Agent on them

CI/CD:
CodeDeploy can be used to deploy to ECS
