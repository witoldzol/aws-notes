*** Security groups
Act like firewall and block all Inboud / Outbound traffic that is not greenlit
Can be attached to multiple instances ( vm's )
Instance can have mutliple groups
They work only within their region ( if you switch region, you have to recreate groups )
They 'live' outside EC2 - they don't run on instances
Defaults: all inbound is blocked and all outbound is allowed
You can reference other security groups
